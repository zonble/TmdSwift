# TMD (Timebase Mark Down) Music Score Specification & Guide

TMD is a plain-text musical notation DSL designed by Taiwanese composer and music producer Chen, Chih-Han / aguai (阿怪, 1974–2019, composer of A-Mei's "Three Days and Three Nights").
It allows musicians and arrangers to describe multi-track songs, numbered musical notation (jianpu / movable-do solfege), chord progressions, tuplets, and playback arrangements in a concise, human-readable text format.

The `tmd` CLI tool compiles `.tmd` files and can export them to MIDI, MusicXML, LilyPond (.ly / PDF), ABC notation (.abc), or render offline audio to WAV.

---

## 1. Minimal File Structure

Every TMD score MUST start with `::SCORE::`.
A minimal valid TMD file consists of:

```tmd
::SCORE::
** Song Title **
!= 120
?= C
<4/4>

intro:Piano@|0|{
    <4*>
    1 2 3 4
}

-> intro ->#
```

### Essential Components:
1. **Header**: `::SCORE::` (must be at the beginning of the score).
2. **Title**: `** Title **` (enclosed in double asterisks).
3. **Tempo**: `!= 120` (in BPM, supports integer or decimals like `!= 120.5`).
4. **Key Signature**: `?= C` (tonic letter `C`..`B`, optional sharp `'` or flat `,`, e.g., `?= A'`, `?= E,`).
5. **Time Signature**: `<4/4>` (numerator/denominator, e.g. `<3/4>`, `<6/8>`).
6. **Paragraphs / Instrument Tracks**: `name:instrument@|offset|{ ... }`.
7. **Playback Flow**: `-> section1 -> section2 ->#` (must start with `->` and terminate with `->#`).

---

## 2. Metadata and Comments

### Comments
Block comments use `/* ... */` and can span multiple lines:
```tmd
/* This is a comment. It will be ignored by the parser. */
```

### Song Metadata Credits
TMD supports credit shorthand using `~ "..."` and named metadata using `=~:__KEY__= "..."`:
```tmd
~ "lyrics: aguai"
~ "composer: aguai"
~ "arranger: Martin Tang"
=~:__ALBUM__= "May 1998"
```
Recognized credit prefix mappings for `~` include:
- Chinese prefixes `詞：`, `曲：`, `編：` or direct keys.

---

## 3. Paragraphs and Instrument Tracks

Syntax:
```tmd
section_name:instrument_name@|start_measure|{
    <note_length*>
    music_units...
}
```

- **`section_name`**: Logical section name (e.g. `intro`, `verse`, `chorus`, `A`, `B`, `bridge`, `ending`).
- **`instrument_name`**: Track/instrument label (e.g. `Piano`, `Guitar`, `Bass`, `Drums`, `Vocal`, `CHORD`, `Strings`).
  Common names are mapped to General MIDI instruments automatically (e.g., `Piano` -> Grand Piano, `Guitar` -> Steel String Guitar, `Drums` / `Groove` -> Channel 10 Drum kit).
- **`start_measure`**: Entry measure offset inside `|...|` (e.g. `@|0|`, `@|+4|`, `@|-1|`).
  - `@|0|` or `@|+0|`: Enters at the beginning of the section.
  - `@|+4|`: Enters 4 measures after the section begins.
  - `@|-1|`: Enters 1 measure before the section begins (pick-up / anticipation measure).
  - Can also omit pipes: `@0` or `@|0|`.

Multiple tracks can share the same section name:
```tmd
intro:CHORD@|0|{
    <2*>
    [1] - [4] -
}

intro:Piano@|0|{
    <4*>
    1 2 3 4
}
```

---

## 4. Sections and Rhythm Grid

Inside a paragraph, music is organized into sections defined by a base subdivision:
```tmd
<note_length*>
```
Where `note_length` defines how many notes of this unit equal a whole note (semibreve):
- `<1*>`: Whole notes
- `<2*>`: Half notes
- `<4*>`: Quarter notes
- `<8*>`: Eighth notes
- `<16*>`: Sixteenth notes

Bar line dividers `|` are optional visual separators for readability and are ignored by the parser:
```tmd
<4*>
| 1 2 3 4 | 5 - 5 - |
```

---

## 5. Musical Units

### 5.1 Numbered Musical Notation (Jianpu / Movable-Do Solfege)
Numbered scale degrees:
- `1`: Do
- `2`: Re
- `3`: Mi
- `4`: Fa
- `5`: Sol
- `6`: La
- `7`: Ti

### 5.2 Accidentals
- `'` (single quote): Sharp (♯)
- `,` (comma): Flat (♭)

Examples: `1'` (C# / Sharp Do), `7,` (B♭ / Flat Ti).

### 5.3 Octave Displacements
- `^`: Higher octave. Multiple `^` raise by multiple octaves (e.g., `1^^`).
- `_`: Lower octave. Multiple `_` lower by multiple octaves (e.g., `1__`).

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Always write the accidental FIRST, then the octave displacement:
> - Correct: `1'^` (Sharp Do, one octave up), `7,_` (Flat Ti, one octave down).
> - Incorrect: `1^'` or `7_,` (syntax error).

### 5.4 Rests
- `0`: Rest of 1 base note length.
- `0 - - -`: Whole-measure rest in `<4*>` (or `0---`).

### 5.5 Ties and Duration Extensions
- `-`: Extends the previous note, chord, or rest by 1 base unit length.
Example in `<4*>` (quarter-note grid):
```tmd
1 -        /* Half note (2 beats) */
1 - - -    /* Whole note (4 beats) */
```

### 5.6 Chords
Chords are wrapped in square brackets `[...]`.
Can be written as:
- Letter roots: `[C]`, `[Cmaj7]`, `[Am]`, `[Am7]`, `[F]`, `[G7]`, `[Bb]`, `[D7#9]`, `[Dm7-5]`, `[Csus4]`
- Movable-do numbered chord degrees: `[1]` (I), `[6m]` (vi), `[4]` (IV), `[5]` (V), `[2m7]` (ii7)
- Chords can also take octaves: `[6_m]` (lower octave minor sixth), `[1^]`
- Chords can be sustained with ties: `[Cmaj7] - - -`

### 5.7 Percussion
Percussion tracks accept velocity / pitch tokens:
- `X`, `x`, `T`, `t`, `S`, `s` representing high-to-low / strong-to-weak percussion hits.
Example:
```tmd
intro:Drums@|0|{
    <16*>
    XsTt x-- XtXs X-x- ts
}
```

### 5.8 Tuplets and Rhythmic Groupings
Syntax:
```tmd
(units...)%(dashes)
```
The number of dashes in `%(...)` defines how many base beats the group occupies:
- `(1 2 3)%(--)`: Triplet fitting 3 notes into the time of 2 base beats.
- `(7, 1)%(--)`: 2 notes fitting into 2 base beats.
- `(1 2 3 4 5)%(--)`: 5-tuplet over 2 base beats.

---

## 6. Section Directives (Mid-Score Changes)

You can place inline directives anywhere inside a section between notes:
- `{!= 140}`: Absolute tempo change (BPM).
- `{!+ 10}`: Relative tempo change (+10 BPM).
- `{?= D}`: Absolute key change to D.
- `{?+ 2}`: Relative key transposition up 2 semitones.
- `{<3/4>}`: Time signature change to 3/4.

Example:
```tmd
<4*>
1 2 {!=140} 3 4
```

---

## 7. Arrangement and Playback Orders

The playback arrangement directs the performance flow and modulations from beginning to end:
```tmd
-> intro -> A -> B -> {?+3} -> C -> ending ->#
```

Rules:
- Starts with `->`.
- References section names defined in paragraphs: `-> intro -> verse -> chorus`.
- Supports key modulations during playback:
  - `{?+3}`: Modulate up 3 semitones.
  - `{?-2}`: Modulate down 2 semitones.
  - `{?=G}`: Modulate to absolute key G.
- Ends with `->#` (terminator).

## 8. Complete Working Example

```tmd
::SCORE::
** Sample Track **
!= 133
?= A'
<4/4>

intro:CHORD@|0|{
    <2*>
    |[1] - | - [7,] |
    |[1] - | - [7,] |
    <4*>
    [1] - - - [7,] - - -
}

intro:Chorus-1@|+4|{
    <16*>
    1_- 1_ - 1_ - - 1_ - 1_ - 1_ 1_ - - -
    1_- 1_ - 1_ - - 1_ - 1_ - 1_ 1_ - - -
}

intro:Guitar@|0|{
    <16*>
    (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 6 7, 6 7, 6
    (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 1 (7,1)%(--) 6 7, 6 7, 6
}

A:CHORD@|0|{
    <2*>
    |[1] - | - - |
    |[5] - | - - |
    |[6m] -| [5] -|
    |[4] - | [5] - |
}

-> intro -> A -> {?-3} -> A -> {?+3} -> ending ->#
```

## 10. AI Composition Methodology: Modular Section-Based Chunking

Unlike unstructured audio waveforms (e.g. Suno/Udio) or monolithic continuous notation (e.g. monolithic ABC/MusicXML files), TMD is built on **Modular Section-Based Chunking**. This provides critical advantages for AI-assisted music generation:

1. **Local Context Encapsulation**:
   - Each section (`intro`, `verse`, `chorus`, `A1`, `B1`) is an isolated, self-contained block.
   - When generating, editing, or orchestrating a specific section (e.g. expanding an 8-measure Chorus to 13 orchestral tracks), the AI only needs to focus on that specific section block, avoiding attention decay across long song timelines.

2. **Error Isolation (No Measure Clock Drift)**:
   - Rhythmic errors or miscalculations within one paragraph block are strictly localized. They do not cascade or offset measure alignment across subsequent sections.
   - The AI can inspect compiler diagnostic messages (e.g. `tmd score.tmd -p`) and fix a single paragraph in isolation.

3. **Progressive Layering and Orchestration**:
   - Start with a single lead track (`verse:Vocal@|0|`), then layer accompanying instruments into the same section (`verse:CHORD@|0|`, `verse:Bass@|0|`, `verse:Drums@|+2|`) without altering the original melody.

## 11. Human Composition Principles & AI Co-Composing Patterns

When assisting human composers or generating new arrangements, follow genuine **Human Composition Principles** rather than random note generation or style-collage diffusion:

### 1. Motif-Driven Architecture
- **Establish a Core Motif**: Begin by identifying or asking for the central melodic or rhythmic motif (usually 2 to 4 bars).
- **Develop, Don't Discard**: Carry the motif across sections through genuine compositional techniques:
  - *Sequence / Transposition (模進)*: Repeat the motif on higher or lower scale degrees.
  - *Inversion (倒影)*: Flip interval directions.
  - *Augmentation & Diminution (時值放大與縮小)*: Double or halve rhythmic durations for contrasting sections.
  - *Antecedent-Consequent Phrasing (問答樂句)*: Frame phrases as question-and-answer pairs resolving on tonic or dominant degrees.

### 2. Voice Leading and Texture Balance
- Maintain clear roles across tracks:
  - **Melody / Lead**: Clear vocal line or solo instrument.
  - **Counter-Melody**: Secondary line filling pauses in the main melody.
  - **Harmonic Pads & Fillers**: Sustained chords or arpeggiated movement.
  - **Bass Line**: Root notes, inversions, and step-wise walking notes anchoring the harmony.
  - **Rhythm Section**: Metric groove establishing tempo and dynamic drive.

### 3. Practical AI Co-Composing Patterns
AI agents should assist human composers through these distinct collaborative patterns:
- **Pattern A: Lead-to-Arrangement**: Given a human melody, generate multi-track accompaniment (chords, bassline, percussion).
- **Pattern B: Motif Continuation**: Given a 2-bar or 4-bar human idea, develop it into a complete structured A/B section.
- **Pattern C: Re-Harmonization**: Propose alternative chord progressions (e.g., standard pop, secondary dominants, modal mixture, or jazz extensions like `[Cmaj9]`, `[Am7]`, `[6m]`, `[2m7-5]`).
- **Pattern D: Style Transformation**: Convert a pop/folk lead sheet into multi-part strings, big band brass, or a full symphony orchestra.
- **Pattern E: Validation & Ear Check Loop**: Run `tmd score.tmd -p` to verify syntax, then render offline audio via `tmd score.tmd -w preview.wav` so the composer can immediately verify voice leading with their ears.

## 12. Contrapuntal Techniques: Canon and Fugue

Writing contrapuntal and polyphonic forms requires strict temporal synchronization and voice independence. TMD's track offset syntax (`@|+N|`) makes constructing canons and fugues deterministic and token-efficient for AI agents:

### 1. Strict Canon with Measure Offsets
In traditional notation, writing a canon requires manually filling preceding rests in entering voices. In TMD, use `@|+N|` to delay entering voices without padding rest tokens:

```tmd
/* Two-Voice Canon at the Octave, 2 measures delayed */
canon:Violin1@|0|{
    <4*>
    1 2 3 1 | 3 4 5 - | 5 6 5 4 | 3 - 1 - |
    2 5_ 1 - | - - - - |
}

canon:Violin2@|+2|{
    <4*>
    1 2 3 1 | 3 4 5 - | 5 6 5 4 | 3 - 1 - |
    2 5_ 1 - | - - - - |
}
```

For a **Canon at the Fifth**, transpose the melody by 4 scale degrees (or use `{?+7}` directives) when authoring the follower voice.

### 2. Fugue Architecture
Follow standard classical/baroque fugal exposition principles:
- **Subject (Dux)**: The primary theme stated alone by Voice 1 (`@|0|`) in the tonic key.
- **Answer (Comes)**: Voice 2 enters at `@|+2|` or `@|+4|`, transposed to the dominant (5th above / 4th below).
- **Countersubject**: While Voice 2 plays the Answer, Voice 1 continues with a contrasting counter-melody, maintaining complementary rhythmic motion (e.g., when one voice sustains, the other moves).
- **Episode**: Modulating passages using fragments of the Subject with motivic sequencing.
- **Stretto**: In climactic sections, introduce successive voice entries at narrower measure offsets (e.g., `@|+1|` instead of `@|+4|`) before previous statements finish, intensifying dramatic tension.
